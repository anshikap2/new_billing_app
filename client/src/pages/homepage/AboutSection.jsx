      <p className="section-text">A <strong>billing invoice</strong> is a document issued by a seller to a buyer, outlining the details of a transaction. It serves as a formal request for payment, listing the goods or services provided, their prices, applicable taxes, and the total amount due. An invoice typically includes essential details such as the invoice number, issue date, due date, and payment terms. It also contains the seller's and buyer's contact information. Businesses use invoices for record-keeping, financial tracking, and tax purposes. A well-structured invoice ensures transparency, prevents disputes, and facilitates smooth transactions between parties.</p>
